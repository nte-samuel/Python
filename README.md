#🐍 Python Data Cleaning & Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies that were systematically cleaned before conducting meaningful analysis. The goal was to transform raw data into a structured format and extract insights through Python libraries.

🔑 Objectives

Import and explore the raw dataset with Python.

Perform data cleaning (handle nulls, duplicates, and outliers).

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and trends.

Prepare the dataset for further modeling or visualization.
