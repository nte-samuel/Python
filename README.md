# 🐍 Python Data Cleaning & Analysis Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies that were systematically cleaned before conducting meaningful analysis. The goal was to transform raw data into a structured format and extract insights through Python libraries.

## 🔑 Objectives

Import and explore the raw dataset with Python.

Perform data cleaning (handle nulls, duplicates, and outliers).

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and trends.

Prepare the dataset for further modeling or visualization.

Data Cleaning Steps:

Handling missing values.

Removing duplicates.

Standardizing text and categorical variables.

Treating outliers for accurate analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights

Cleaned dataset reduced inconsistencies, making it reliable for analysis.

Identified trends and correlations between key variables.

Generated summary statistics that provided a deeper understanding of the data distribution.

Visualizations revealed hidden patterns and supported better decision-making.

## 🎯 Outcome

The Python Data Cleaning & Analysis Project produced a well-structured dataset and meaningful insights. It highlights the importance of preprocessing in data science workflows and sets the foundation for predictive modeling and advanced analytics.

# 💰 Automating CoinMarketCap Data with Python & Power BI Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview
